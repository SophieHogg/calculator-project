I decided to base my calculator on this particular kids calculator as it seemed simple without being too antiquated or too boring. I removed the +- toggle and instead widened the AC button to ensure there were no blanks in the grid.

My colour palettes for my websites are usually designed on Australian flora.
I used this colour palette based on a banksia (since my first portfolio project has a colour palette based on gum trees)

I have fixed the calculator to able to work with multiple operators by using loops, simplified the code with the exp variable being used
I have also prevented an operator to be printed as the first character.
