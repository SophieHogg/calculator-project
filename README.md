I decided to base my calculator on this particular kids calculator as it seemed simple without being too antiquated.

My colour palettes for my websites are usually designed on Australian flora.
I used this colour palette based on a banksia (since my first portfolio project has a colour palette based on gum trees)

I also need to move the calculator and the website into separate repos as per Martyna's advice.
